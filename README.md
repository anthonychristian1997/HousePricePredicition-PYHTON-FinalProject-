# HousePricePredicition-PYHTON-FinalProject-
In this repository, I use the House dataset. Try to predict house prices using machine learning.
In searching for house price predictions, 
I use several machine-learning methods such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Linear Regression, Ridge, Elastic Net, and Lasso. 
Helped by the GridSearch method to find the best parameters for each model. In this project, 
I obtained the results of the Decision Tree method providing the highest RSME value.
